# Nordgen
Generate Norwegian passwords, either from a dictionary, or, from location names in Norway. 
See [my blog](https://hamb.ro/posts/placenames/) on how the `lowernocommas` location dict was created. `nor-nb` was downloaded from `xkcdpass`. 

# Setup
Run `pip install -r requirements.py`, followed by a `FLASK_APP=test.py flask run --host=0.0.0.0`. Visit `localhost:5000` and you'll see the result. 

# Example
Visit [hamb.ro:5000](hamb.ro:5000).
